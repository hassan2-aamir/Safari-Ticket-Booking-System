<h1>This is a ticket booking system</h1> 
 
The idea is to make a ticket booking system for a safari park. Details regarding the tickets are as follows:
There are 2 types of tickets , a 12 hour ticket (day tour only) and a 24 hour ticket (including an overnight stay). The prices for the tickets will be as follows:

<h2>Ticket Details</h2>

One adult
12 hour cost: 2000 Rs
24 hour cost: 3000 Rs

One child
12 hour cost: 1000 Rs
24 hour cost: 2000 Rs

One senior
12 hour cost: 1500 Rs
24 hour cost: 2500 Rs

Family ticket (2 adults/ seniors and 3 children )
12 hour cost: 6000 Rs
24 hour cost: 9000 Rs

6+ people (price per person)
12 hour cost: 1000 Rs
24 hour cost: 2000 Rs

An extra attraction can also be added in the following prices per person:

Lion feeding
250 Rs

Penguin feeding
200 Rs

Evening bbq
500 Rs

<h2>Modules</h2>

The program will cover 5 main modules :  

Module 1 : Displaying the options
It will display all the options and prices for the 12 hour tickets and the 24 hour tickets. It will also show the extra options ie. lion feeding etc.

Module 2 : Making the booking
It will take input the tickets and extra attractions required and the calculate the total cost. It will also allocate a booking number. After taking the input it will ask for confirmation by displaying booking number and booking details. It will check that the booking made has the best value and offer a better alternative if it is available after the booking. It will store the ticket booking in a file that is used to or all the tickets booked for a particular date.
 
Module 3: Displaying the bookings made for a date.
It will access the file and display all the bookings for that date.

Module 4: Deleting a booking
It will take the date and booking number and delete it from the specific file. 

Module 5: Summary of bookings on a date
It will take a file and calculate total bookings of each type on that day. It will also tell the total money earned for that day.

Module 6: Creating a menu to access options
This will create a menu that will allow users to navigate to options ie. See ticket options, Make a booking, Explore deals.
